# TF-IDF
A Java Program to Calculate TF-IDF values

This program prints the tf-idf values of each unique word present in each document.
Here I have used 5 '.txt' documents buts you can use any number of documents by specifying their name and proper location and by changing the program a bit. But if you choose 1 file then the tf-idf value will not be correct as to calculate tf-idf values we need atleast 2 files. 

Any queries/doubts regarding the program ?
Feel free to ping me up anytime. I will try to resolve it as soon as possible.
